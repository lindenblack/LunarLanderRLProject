##Introduction
In this project I train and compare four different RL methods using the OpenAI Gym Discrete Lunar Lander environment. 

The states within the environment are:
- x coordinate
- y coordinate
- x velocity
- y velocity
- lander angle
- lander angular velocity
- leg 1 angular contact
- leg 2 angular contact

The actions inlude:
- do nothing
- fire left orientation engine
- fire main engine
- fire right orientation engine
